# A filterable, responsive resume theme for WordPress

Here are the instructions to use the resume theme:

## Installation:
1. Install WordPress somewhere
2. Download and install the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. (I used the pro version but I assume the standard will work fine.)
3. Download [here](https://github.com/TeslaDethray/wp-resume/releases/download/0.1.0/resume.zip), uncompress, and add the resulting resume theme dir to to `/wp-content/themes`

## Setup:
1.  Complete WordPress setup (go to site URL and follow prompts)
3.  Log into WordPress
4.  Go to Plugins > Installed plugins
5.  Activate Advanced Custom Fields (PRO)
6.  Go to Appearance > Themes
7.  Activate Resume theme

## Filling it in:
1. Go to Settings > General and make the site title your name, the tagline your job title.
2. Go to Skills first and fill in each of the filterable skills you plan on using.
3. Go to each of Education, Experience, Projects, and Summary and fill in each, linking skills.
4. Go to the widgets and add up to four images and a personal summary blurb.

## Notes:
- The skills attached to Experience are general job skills not otherwise listed in the job events
- The skills attached to Experience events will be used to filter specific job events using those skills
- The personal photos and blurb are presently required. They will be un-required soon.
